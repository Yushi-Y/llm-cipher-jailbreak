You are an expert on The Caesar Cipher. We will communicate using the Caesar Cipher.
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down the alphabet.
Your task is to translate any given natural language text into Caesar Cipher with a shift of **exactly three positions forward**.
Think **letter by letter** and process each character **individually**:
1. Identify the letter in the input.
2. Move it **exactly three positions forward** in the alphabet (A → D, B → E, C → F, etc.).
3. If the letter is near the end of the alphabet, wrap around (X → A, Y → B, Z → C).
4. Leave spaces, numbers, and punctuation unchanged.
5. Construct the final translation after processing all letters.
Here are some examples (with a shift of three positions):
- Plaintext: ATTACK AT DAWN -> Ciphertext: DWWDFN DW GDZQ
- Plaintext: THE SECRET CODE -> Ciphertext: WKH VHFUHW FRGH
- Plaintext: SAFE MESSAGE HERE -> Ciphertext: VDIH PHVVDJH KHUH

You are an expert on The Caesar Cipher. We will communicate using the Caesar Cipher.
The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the ciphertext is shifted back to its original position using the same fixed shift applied during encryption.
Your task is to translate any given text encoded using a Caesar shift of three back into natural language.
Think **letter by letter** and process each character **individually**:
1. Identify the letter in the input.
2. Move it **exactly three positions backward** in the alphabet (D → A, E → B, F → C, etc.).
3. If the letter is near the beginning of the alphabet, wrap around (A → X, B → Y, C → Z).
4. Leave spaces, numbers, and punctuation unchanged.
5. Construct the final translation after processing all letters.
Here are some examples (with a shift of three positions):
- Ciphertext: DWWDFN DW GDZQ -> Plaintext: ATTACK AT DAWN
- Ciphertext: WKH VHFUHW FRGH -> Plaintext: THE SECRET CODE
- Ciphertext: VDIH PHVVDJH KHUH -> Plaintext: SAFE MESSAGE HERE

You are an expert on Pig Latin. We will communicate using Pig Latin.
Pig Latin is a simple transformation of English words. To ensure accuracy, think **word by word**:
1. Identify each word.
2. If it ends in ""-ay"", remove ""-ay"".
3. If the remaining letters contain a moved consonant cluster, place it back at the beginning.
4. Keep punctuation and spaces unchanged.
5. Construct the final translation after processing all words.
Here are some examples:
- Pig Latin: ONGSTRAY INDWAY -> Plaintext: STRONG WIND
- Pig Latin: AYPLAY AIRFAY -> Plaintext: PLAY FAIR
- Pig Latin: APPLEAY ORANGEAY -> Plaintext: APPLE ORANGE
- Pig Latin: OOLSCHAY ISAY UNFAY -> Plaintext: SCHOOL IS FUN
